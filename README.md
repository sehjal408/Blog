## Introduction to Linux and Installing Ubuntu

Linux is an open-source operating system like other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google android, etc. An operating system is a software that enables the communication between computer hardware and software. It conveys input to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to display it. This is the basic function of an operating system. Its main benefits are –
- Being open-source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it. 
- The Linux operating systems now offer millions of programs/applications and Linux softwares to choose from, most of them are free! 
- Once you have Linux installed you no longer need an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system. More so, there is a global development community constantly looking at ways to enhance its security. With each upgrade, the OS becomes more secure and robust 
- Linux freeware is the OS of choice for Server environments due to its stability and reliability (Mega-companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google use Linux for their Servers). A Linux based server could run non-stop without a reboot for years on end.

## Introduction to Frappe

Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers erpnext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

<h3 align='center'>Pagination on webpage in Library Management System</h3>
Firstly, i had created a library management system which had 5 doctypes. I gave web view to Article doctype. Then two files article_row.html and article.html were automatically generated in doctype folder. On webpageof Article doctype, whole list of articles was visible. But we wanted to apply pagination on the webpage. So i tried from a video (url: https://youtu.be/rDC-5ZJTmOU ). 
I created a file utils.py in library_management folder where i write the function of pagination for showing 4 articles on single page. 
Then in video, two files python and html were created in www > Article folder. I did the same but it didn't worked for me. After trying many ways, i created these files directly in www folder, then it worked. In python file, pagination function was called. And in html file i write jinja code to display the list on webpage and applied "previous" and "next" buttons. 
Now 4 articles are visible on webpage and previous, next buttons are working fine.
